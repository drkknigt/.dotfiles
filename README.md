# personal dotfiles  

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configuration files for various applications and tools.

This directory structure contains configuration files for various applications and tools I use, including terminal emulators (alacritty, kitty), window manager (i3), text editors (neovim, vim), terminal multiplexer (tmux), and others.

The bin directory contains various shell scripts related to system administration tasks like managing screen brightness, checking battery status, handling Wi-Fi connections, and more.
